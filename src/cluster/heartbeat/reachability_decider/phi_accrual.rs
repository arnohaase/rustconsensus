/// The [PhiAccrualDecider] assumes that the time between two received heartbeats (i.e. including
///  the regular heartbeat interval) follows a Gaussian distribution, and it does a sliding-window
///  fit of mean and standard deviation based on actually measured arrival intervals.
///
/// This model describes the probability distribution of delays between heartbeats, and for a given
///  delay t the integral from t to +âˆž predicts the probability that a next heartbeat is going to
///  arrive if we wait long enough (as opposed to the system being permanently unreachable).
///
/// An application can set a threshold for the probability, which is then dynamically mapped to
///  up-to-date measurements on the network - application configuration does not need to take
///  network RTT etc. into account explicitly. This approach and the algorithm used here is
///  based on https://oneofus.la/have-emacs-will-hack/files/HDY04.pdf.
///
/// This strategy is included mainly because it is widely used in Akka. There are some conceptual
///  concerns to consider when using it:
/// * The original paper is based on flaky international connections rather than reliable,
///    pretty deterministic networks inside a single data center.
/// * 'Good' networks can lead to very repeatable heartbeat intervals, causing extremely narrow
///    Gaussian peaks, causing even small anomalies to be treated as permanent unavailabilities.
///    We mitigate this by setting a lower bound of 100ms for std deviation (following Akkas
///    implementation), giving up much of the precision of the approach
/// * Inside data centers, heartbeat messages tend to arrive in multiples of the heartbeat send
///    interval (with comparatively little jitter of network RTT) - and a Gaussian distribution
///    is not a good fit for this kind of disjoint peaks
/// * The sliding-window approach does not take occasional delays caused by load peaks on one of the
///    machines etc. into account - the Gaussian fit is based on the most recent N intervals, and
///    things that did not happen in that time frame don't exist as far as the algorithm is
///    concerned. While it is possible to add a configurable interval for this, it pretty much
///    countermands the benefits of the phi accrual algorithm.

/// The [PhiAccrualDecider] estimates the probability that a node is permanently unreachable based
///  on the elapsed time since the last heartbeat was received, allowing an application to set
///  a threshold based on that probability rather than some technical values (like a timeout
///  period).
///
/// The estimation approach used here is based on ,
///  calculating mean and standard deviation of the interval between heartbeats from past measurements
///  and approximating the probability distribution by a Gaussian distribution.
