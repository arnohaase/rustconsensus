* initial start-up; seed nodes etc.
* cluster join
* termination / shutdown
* downing
* weakly up

* MembershipState::is_gossip_partner
  * and remove from 'seen by' if not gossip partner anymore
* convergence
* cleanup; removal of converged 'is_reachable=true'

* increased gossip frequency when not converged

ideas
-----
* more relaxed convergence model per node - this might work if we add the requirement that new nodes must come 'after'
   the current leader, but it requires serious thought
